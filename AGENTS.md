# Halfspace

Halfspace is an open-source, local-first football workbench. Users bring their own Sportmonks
token; browsing cached football data should feel instant.

Stack: Electron/electron-vite, React + TypeScript, shadcn/ui + Tailwind, TanStack Router, and
Dexie/IndexedDB.

Keep Electron thin: secrets and Sportmonks requests live in main, cached football data lives in
the renderer, and preload exposes only narrow typed APIs. Avoid duplicate caches and premature
abstractions.

## Product Design

- Required setup states use a focused fullscreen flow before the main app appears.
- Use direct, singular page headings. Do not add eyebrow labels or pretitles above them.
- Avoid prototype copy, implementation explanations, and redundant guidance. Text should name the
  current thing, communicate a meaningful state, or enable an action.
- Build the product outward through dedicated football entity pages and natural links between
  them. Prioritize entity depth before secondary tools or dashboards.
- Keep low-resolution provider imagery in compact supporting cards. Do not stretch it into hero
  treatment that exposes its limitations.
- Show every active subscribed competition in the sidebar when there are 10 or fewer. Above 10,
  show only locally pinned competitions.

## Mindset & Process

- Fix issues from first principles. Do not apply bandaids when the root cause can be identified and
  solved directly.
- Leave no breadcrumbs when moving or deleting code. Remove the old code cleanly.
- Clean up unused code as part of the change.
- Write idiomatic, simple, maintainable code. Prefer the most intuitive solution that fully solves
  the problem.
- If you discover something new, or the user mentions something worth remembering, add it to
  `AGENTS.md`.
- Run `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm format`, and `pnpm lint` after touching JavaScript or TypeScript files.

## Compatibility Code

- Treat compatibility code as a temporary cost, not a default precaution.
- Only introduce it when an existing deployed, external, or non-atomic boundary requires old and
  new behavior to coexist.
- If we control all consumers and can update them in the same change, do not write a shim; update
  the code directly.
- Never add compatibility layers for speculative needs, undeployed changes, or internal-only
  package transitions.
- Any required compatibility path must state what it preserves, why it is needed, and when it
  should be removed.

## Testing Discipline

- Use the three laws of TDD as a guiding discipline for logic-heavy code, not as a strict rule for
  all development:
  - Write a failing test before writing production code.
  - Do not write more of a test than is sufficient to fail or fail to compile.
  - Do not write more production code than is sufficient to make the currently failing test pass.
- Prioritize tests for:
  - Core business logic
  - Critical user flows
  - Previously broken functionality
- Regression tests are for preventing confirmed bugs from returning.
- For regression tests:
  - Write a test that reproduces the bug.
  - Run it and confirm it fails for the right reason.
  - Fix the bug.
  - Rerun the test and confirm it passes.
- Do not write regression tests for discussion outcomes, design direction changes, or speculative
  behavior that was never a reproduced bug.
- Test behavior, not implementation details.
  - Avoid asserting incidental structure such as class names, private helpers, or internal wiring.
  - For visual design, prefer real visual snapshots over targeted assertions.
